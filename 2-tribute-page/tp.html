         <p id="tribute-info">His writings were widely read both within and beyond his native Russia and influenced an equally great number of later writers including Russians such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Anton Chekhov, poet Yegor Letov, philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre, and the emergence of Existentialism and Freudianism.</p>
           <p id="tribute-info">His books have been translated into more than 170 languages, and served as the inspiration for many films.</p>
